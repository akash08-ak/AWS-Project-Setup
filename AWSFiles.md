## 🚀 Jenkins Pipeline (`Jenkinsfile`)
Automates the process of building, testing, and deploying applications.

### 📌 Code:
```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any  // Use any available agent

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building the project...'  // Simulating build step
            }
        }

        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Running tests...'  // Simulating test step
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying application...'  // Simulating deployment step
            }
        }
    }
}
```

🧐 Explanation:  
✅ Uses agent any to allow execution on any available node.  
✅ Defines three stages:  
✅ Build 🏗: Simulates project compilation.  
✅ Test 🧪: Executes test cases.  
✅ Deploy 🚢: Simulates app deployment.

## 📦 Docker (`Dockerfile`)
Defines the setup for a Node.js container.

### 📌 Code:
```# Use Node.js version 18 as the base image  
FROM node:18  

# Set the working directory inside the container  
WORKDIR /app  

# Copy all project files into the container  
COPY . .  

# Install dependencies listed in package.json  
RUN npm install  

# Expose the application port (3000) to allow external access  
EXPOSE 3000  

# Start the application using Node.js  
CMD ["node", "index.js"]
```


🧐 Explanation:  
✅ Uses Node.js 18 as the base image.  
✅ Sets /app as the working directory.   
✅ Copies project files, installs dependencies, and exposes port 3000.   
✅ Launches the app using Node.js.

## ☸️ Kubernetes (`kubernetes.yaml`)
Defines an application deployment and service.

### 📌 Deployment Code:
```
# Define a deployment to manage application instances
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app  # Name of the deployment
spec:
  replicas: 2  # Number of instances (pods)
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app  # Select pods with this label
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app  # Label assigned to pods
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-container  # Name of the container inside the pod
          image: nginx  # Docker image for the container (replace with your app)
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80  # Port the container listens on
```
### 📌 Service Code:
```
# Define a service to expose the deployment internally
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-app-service  # Name of the service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app  # Connects to pods with this label
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP  # Communication protocol
      port: 80  # Port exposed by the service
      targetPort: 80  # Maps to the container's port
  type: ClusterIP  # Internal-only service (no external access)
```
🧐 Explanation:    
✅ Deployment: Runs nginx in 2 replicas inside pods.  
✅ Service: Provides an internal connection using ClusterIP.

## ☁️ Terraform (`terraform.tf`)
Creates an AWS EC2 instance.

### 📌 Code:
```
provider "aws" {  # Define AWS as the cloud provider
  region = "us-east-1"  # Set the deployment region
}

resource "aws_instance" "my_instance" {  # Create an EC2 instance
  ami           = "ami-12345678"  # Replace with a valid AMI ID
  instance_type = "t2.micro"  # Smallest instance type (free-tier eligible)
}
```
🧐 Explanation:    
✅ Defines AWS as the provider in us-east-1.   
✅ Creates an EC2 instance with a placeholder AMI.

## 🔧 Ansible (`ansible.yaml`)
Automates Python installation across remote systems.

### 📌 Code:
```
- name: Install Python
  hosts: all  # Target all remote machines
  become: yes  # Run as sudo (admin)
  tasks:
    - name: Install Python package
      ansible.builtin.apt:  # Use apt for Debian-based systems (Ubuntu)
        name: python3
        state: present
      when: ansible_os_family == "Debian"

    - name: Install Python package
      ansible.builtin.yum:  # Use yum for RHEL-based systems (CentOS, Fedora)
        name: python3
        state: present
      when: ansible_os_family == "RedHat"
```

🧐 Explanation:  
✅ Installs Python using apt (Debian) or yum (RedHat).   
✅ Uses conditional logic (when) based on the OS type.

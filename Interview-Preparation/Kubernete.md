# 🧠 Kubernetes Overview

**Kubernetes** is an open-source platform used for container management, including:

- 🚀 **Deployment automation**
- 📈 **Container scaling**
- ⚖️ **Load balancing**

It automates the **scheduling**, **running**, and **management** of isolated containers across **virtual**, **physical**, or **cloud** environments.

✅ All major cloud providers (like **AWS**, **Azure**, and **GCP**) support Kubernetes.

# 🕰️ History of Kubernetes

- 🏗️ Developed by **Google** based on their internal system called **Borg** (later evolved into **Omega**) used to manage thousands of applications and services.
- 📅 In **2014**, Google introduced **Kubernetes** as an open-source project.
- 💻 Written in **Go (Golang)**.
- 🌐 Donated to the **Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)**.

# ⚠️ Problems Before Kubernetes 

- 🔌 **Containers could not communicate with each other**  
  → Difficult to manage distributed applications.

- 📉 **Autoscaling and load balancing were not possible**  
  → Manual intervention was needed to handle traffic and resource spikes.

- 🧩 **Scaling up containers was complex**  
  → Required significant configuration and management effort.

- 🧯 **Containers had to be managed carefully**  
  → No built-in tools for health checks, failover, or rolling updates.

# 🌟 Key Features of Kubernetes

- 📈 **Autoscaling**  
  Automatically scales containers based on CPU/memory usage or custom metrics.
  - 🔄 **HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler)**: Changes the number of pods.  
  - 📏 **VPA (Vertical Pod Autoscaler)**: Changes pod resource limits (CPU/RAM).

- ❤️ **Auto-Healing**  
  Restarts failed containers, replaces and reschedules them if nodes die.

- ⚖️ **Load Balancing**  
  Distributes network traffic evenly across containers.

- 🌍 **Platform Independent**  
  Runs on cloud, virtual, or physical machines.

- 🛡️ **Fault Tolerance**  
  Handles node or pod failures without affecting application availability.

- ⏪ **Rollback**  
  Supports rolling back to a previous version of an application.

- 🩺 **Health Monitoring**  
  Monitors container health using liveness and readiness probes.

- 🗂️ **Batch Execution**  
  Supports one-time jobs and batch processing (sequential or parallel).

# ☸️ Kubernetes Architecture

![K8s Architecture](https://github.com/akash08-ak/AWS-Project-Setup/blob/main/Images/Kubernetes%20architecture.png)

## 🧠 Control Plane Components

- **API Server**: Central communication point; all control components talk through it.
- **Kube Scheduler**: Assigns Pods to available Nodes based on resource availability.
- **etcd**: A key-value database that stores cluster state (e.g., Pods, nodes, IPs).
- **Controller Manager**: Ensures desired state matches actual state by coordinating with API Server.

## ⚙️ Node/Worker Plane (Data Plane)

- **Kubelet**: Talks to API Server, manages Pods, runs containers via runtime (e.g., Docker).
- **Kube-proxy**: Assigns IPs, enables networking and load-balancing across Pods.
- **Container Runtime**: Tool like Docker, Podman, containerd to run containers.
- **Pod**: Smallest unit in K8s, can contain one or more containers sharing network/storage.

## 📈 **Kubernetes Cluster Flow – Step-by-Step**

1. 🧑‍💻 **User Sends Request**
   - A user (or CI/CD pipeline) submits a YAML file (e.g., `Deployment`, `Service`) to the **API Server**.
   - This YAML defines the **desired state** (e.g., 3 Pods of a web app).

2. 🧭 **API Server Receives & Validates**
   - API Server **validates** the YAML and **stores** it in **etcd** (the database of the cluster).
   - etcd now holds the "desired state" of the cluster.

3. 🔍 **Controller Manager Detects Difference**
   - The **Controller Manager** constantly monitors etcd for any difference between:
     - What the user wants (desired state)
     - What is currently running (actual state)

4. ⚠️ **Mismatch Found**
   - If there’s a difference (e.g., 0 Pods running but 3 requested), the Controller Manager takes **action**.

5. 🧠 **Scheduler Kicks In**
   - The **Scheduler** is triggered via the **API Server**.
   - It picks the **best Node** for the new Pod(s) based on:
     - Available CPU/memory
     - Node affinity
     - Taints and tolerations

6. 🛰️ **Kubelet on Target Node**
   - Once the Node is selected, the **Kubelet** (agent on that Node) receives the instructions from the API Server.
   - Kubelet uses the **Container Runtime** (like Docker or containerd) to **pull images** and **start containers** inside a **Pod**.

7. 🧠 **Kube-proxy Handles Networking**
   - The **Kube-proxy** on the Node assigns a **cluster IP** to the Pod.
   - It updates the **network rules** for service discovery and load balancing.

8. 📝 **Status Sent Back**
   - Node status and Pod health are continuously sent back to the API Server and stored in **etcd**.
   - Now, the **actual state = desired state**, so no further action is taken until the next change.

# 📦 Kubernetes Objects & Cluster State

Kubernetes uses **Objects** to represent the **desired state** of your cluster. These objects define:

- 📍 **What containerized applications** are running  
- 🖥️ **Which nodes** they run on  
- ⚙️ **How they should behave**, including:  
  - 🔁 Restart policies  
  - ⬆️ Upgrades  
  - 🛡️ Fault tolerance
- 🔑 Each object is uniquely identified by:
  - 🏷️ Name
  - 🆔 UID (Unique Identifier)

Once an object is created, **Kubernetes continuously works to match the actual cluster state with the desired state**.

---

## 🧱 Structure of a Kubernetes Object

Each Kubernetes object has two key fields:

### 1. 📝 `spec` (Specification)
- Defines the **desired state** of the object.
- You provide this when creating the object.
- Example: “I want 3 replicas of this pod running.”

### 2. 📊 `status`
- Reflects the **current state** of the object.
- Updated by the **Kubernetes system**.
- Shows if the system is achieving the desired state.

## 📚 Basic Kubernetes Objects

| 🔢 | Object        | Description |
|----|---------------|-------------|
| 1️⃣ | **Pod**         | 🧩 Smallest deployable unit; runs containers |
| 2️⃣ | **Service**     | 🌐 Exposes a group of pods via a stable network |
| 3️⃣ | **Volume**      | 💾 Provides persistent storage to containers |
| 4️⃣ | **Namespace**   | 🗂️ Isolates groups of resources in a cluster |
| 5️⃣ | **ReplicaSet**  | 🔁 Ensures a specified number of pod replicas |
| 6️⃣ | **Secret**      | 🔐 Stores sensitive info like passwords, tokens |
| 7️⃣ | **ConfigMap**   | 🧾 Stores config data in key-value format |
| 8️⃣ | **Deployment**  | 🚀 Manages updates and rollbacks of pods |
| 9️⃣ | **Job**         | ✅ Runs pods until a task completes successfully |
| 🔟 | **DaemonSet**   | 📦 Ensures a pod runs on all (or some) nodes |

# 🔗 Relationships Between Kubernetes Objects

Understanding how Kubernetes objects relate to each other helps manage your applications more effectively:

- 🧩 **Pod** → Manages one or more **containers** (e.g., Tomcat, Ubuntu).
- 🔁 **ReplicaSet** → Ensures the desired number of **pod replicas** are running at all times.
- 🌐 **Service** → Exposes **pods** to the **outside world** (or internal traffic) and handles load balancing.
- ⚙️ **ConfigMap** → Provides **configuration data** to pods (non-sensitive).
- 🔐 **Secret** → Provides **sensitive data** (like API keys, passwords) securely to pods.
- 🗄️ **Volume** → Provides **persistent storage** to containers in a pod.
- 🚀 **Deployment** → Manages **ReplicaSets**, enabling **rolling updates** and **rollbacks**.
- ✅ **Job** → Runs pods to **completion** for batch/one-time tasks.
- 📦 **DaemonSet** → Ensures a **pod copy** runs on **all (or selected)** nodes.
- 🗂️ **Namespace** → Organizes Kubernetes resources into **logical groups**.

---

## 📄 Kubernetes Object Files

Kubernetes objects are typically defined in:

- 🧾 **YAML** or 🧱 **JSON** format  
- Created manually or generated by tools (e.g., Helm)

## 🧰 State of Objects

| 🏷️ **Field**    | 📝 **Description**                                              |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🔢 `replicas`    | Number of desired pod instances (e.g., `2/2`)                  |
| 🚀 `startup`     | Defines how the container should start                         |
| 🖼️ `image`       | Base container image (e.g., `tomcat`, `ubuntu`)                |
| 🧷 `detached`    | Run container in the background (default behavior)             |
| 🏷️ `name`       | Name of the object                                              |
| 🔌 `port`        | Port to expose for communication                               |
| 💾 `volume`      | Persistent storage details                                      |

# ⚙️ Kubernetes Objects Management

Kubernetes objects can be created and managed using different approaches, supported by the `kubectl` command-line tool.


| 🧰 **Management Technique**      | 📦 **Operates On**           | 🌍 **Recommended Environment**    |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| 🧾 **Imperative Commands**     | Live objects (in-cluster)     | 🧪 Development & Testing          |
| 📄 **Declarative Configuration** | YAML/JSON files (object config) | ✅ Production & CI/CD environments |

---

## 🧾 Declarative vs. Imperative

### 📄 Declarative

- You **declare** the desired state using configuration files (YAML/JSON).
- Kubernetes figures out **how** to reach that state.
- Promotes **repeatability**, **version control**, and **infrastructure as code**.

### 🧰 Imperative
- You issue commands directly to make changes.
- Good for quick tests, development, and learning.

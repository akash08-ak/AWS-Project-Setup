# ☁️ Cloud Basics & 🚀 AWS Introduction
---
### 🌥️ Cloud Computing
Cloud computing means using the internet to access computing power, storage, and applications whenever you need them, instead of buying and maintaining physical servers. You only pay for what you use, just like paying for electricity or water. This makes it flexible and cost-effective for businesses and individuals.


### 🌎 AWS Global Infrastructure (Regions, AZs, Edge Locations)
AWS is a giant network of computers spread across the world. These computers are placed in different locations to make cloud services fast, reliable, and secure for people everywhere.

- **📍 Regions** – Big areas where AWS has a lot of computers. Each region has multiple Availability Zones (AZs) inside it.
- **🏢 Availability Zones (AZs)** – Groups of data centers inside a region. If one AZ faces a problem, the others keep things running smoothly.
- **📡 Edge Locations** – Small centers placed in many locations to deliver content quickly. They help websites and apps load faster by storing data closer to users.


### ⚙️ Service Models: IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS
- **🛠️ IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)** – You get raw materials (servers, storage) to build things.
  - Example: AWS EC2, Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines.
  
- **🧰 PaaS (Platform as a Service)** – You get tools to build apps faster.
  - Example: Google App Engine, AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
  
- **📦 SaaS (Software as a Service)** – You get a ready-to-use app.
  - Example: Gmail, Dropbox, Microsoft 365.


### ☁️ Deployment Models: Public, Private, Hybrid Cloud
- **🌍 Public Cloud** – Services available to anyone over the internet. Managed by cloud providers like AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud.
  - Example: Google Drive, AWS S3, Microsoft OneDrive.
  
- **🏠 Private Cloud** – A cloud dedicated to one organization. Can be hosted on-premises or by a third-party provider.
  - Example: A bank or government agency managing its own cloud infrastructure.
  
- **🔄 Hybrid Cloud** – A mix of public and private clouds. Businesses use private clouds for sensitive data and public clouds for scalability.
  - Example: A company storing customer data securely in a private cloud but using a public cloud for running applications.

1. Choose an **Amazon Machine Image (AMI)** containing the OS and software configurations.
2. Select an **instance type** based on CPU, memory, storage, and networking requirements.
3. Configure **Security Groups** (firewall rules).
4. Set up **key pairs** for SSH access.

### 🔑 Key Pairs (Secure Authentication)
Key pairs are used for secure authentication when connecting to EC2 instances.

- **🔓 Public Key** – Stored by AWS.
- **🔑 Private Key** – Downloaded and used for secure login.

### 🖼️ Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)
AMIs are templates that define the OS and software for an EC2 instance.

You can:
- Use **AWS-provided AMIs**.
- Create **custom AMIs**.
- Share **AMIs with other AWS accounts**.

#### 🖥️ How to Share an AMI with Another AWS Account

- Open the **EC2 Dashboard** → Click **"Images"** → **"AMIs"**  
- Find the AMI you want to share  
- Click **"Modify Image Permissions"**  
- Choose **"Private"** sharing  
- Enter the **AWS account ID** you want to share the AMI with  
- Click **"Save"**  
- The AMI is now accessible by the target AWS account  
- The receiving account can now **launch instances** from the shared AMI  
- They can **copy the AMI** to their own account if needed   


### 🛡️ Security Groups (Firewall Protection)
Security Groups function as virtual firewalls, controlling inbound and outbound traffic.

They:
- **✅ Allow or ❌ Deny** specific network traffic.
- **🔄 Are stateful**, meaning responses to allowed requests are automatically permitted.


### 🔄 Auto Scaling Groups
#### Definition
Auto Scaling Groups in AWS automatically adjust the number of servers based on demand.

#### 📌 Example
Imagine you run an online store. During sales, more people visit, and you need extra servers. Auto Scaling Groups add or remove servers dynamically, saving costs while keeping your site running smoothly.


### ⚖️ Load Balancers (ALB, NLB)
#### Definition
Load Balancers distribute incoming traffic across multiple resources to ensure high availability and optimal performance.

#### Types
- **🌐 Application Load Balancer (ALB)**
  - Operates at Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS).
  - Supports host-based and path-based routing.
  - Ideal for microservices.

- **🔗 Network Load Balancer (NLB)**
  - Operates at Layer 4 (TCP/UDP).
  - Handles high-performance, low-latency traffic.

#### 🍽️ Example
Think of a restaurant with multiple chefs. If everyone orders from one chef, they get overwhelmed. Load Balancers distribute traffic across multiple servers, just like spreading orders among chefs.


### 🖥️ AWS Lambda (Serverless Functions)
#### Definition
AWS Lambda lets you run code without managing servers. It executes only when triggered.

#### ⚡ Example
Instead of running a server all the time, Lambda runs small functions on demand (like sending a confirmation email after a purchase). No server management—just instant execution.

## 🌍 Route 53 (DNS Service)
Route 53 is like your phone’s contact list, mapping domain names to IP addresses.

- **🔄 Helps route traffic efficiently.**
- **📡 Manages DNS resolution globally.**


### 🚀 Functions of AWS Route 53

#### 1. **🌐 DNS Management**
- Route 53 is a **highly available** and **scalable** DNS service.
- It translates **domain names** (e.g., `www.example.com`) into **IP addresses** (`xx.xx.xx.xx`) so browsers can locate servers.

#### 2. **🔀 Traffic Management**
- If you purchase a domain from **GoDaddy** but host your site on **AWS**, Route 53 ensures traffic reaches AWS servers correctly.
- It provides **routing policies** such as:
  - ✅ **Simple Routing**: Maps a domain to a single IP.
  - ⚡ **Latency-Based Routing**: Directs users to the closest AWS region for lower latency.
  - 🌍 **Geolocation Routing**: Routes users based on their physical location.
  - 🔄 **Failover Routing**: Redirects traffic to backup servers if the primary server fails.

#### 3. **📊 Availability Management**
- Route 53 **monitors server health** using **health checks** 🏥.
- If a server fails ❌, Route 53 **automatically redirects traffic** to another healthy server ✅.
- It enables **high availability** by distributing traffic across multiple resources.

#### 4. **📝 Domain Name Registration**
- You can **purchase domain names** directly from **AWS Route 53** 🔑.
- If you own a domain elsewhere (e.g., **GoDaddy**), you can **transfer** it to Route 53 for centralized management 🔄.


### 🌎 How Route 53 Resolves DNS Queries
![Route 53 Diagram](https://github.com/akash08-ak/AWS-Project-Setup/blob/main/Images/Route-53.png)

1. **User requests** `www.example.com` 💻.
2. The request goes to a **DNS resolver** (usually provided by the ISP 🔍).
3. If cached, the resolver immediately returns the IP. Otherwise:
   - The resolver queries the **Root DNS Server** 🏛, which directs it to the appropriate **Top-Level Domain (TLD) Server** (e.g., `.com`, `.in`).
   - The TLD server forwards the request to **Route 53’s authoritative name server** 🏠, which stores the domain’s IP address.
   - The resolver retrieves the IP 📦 and forwards it to the user’s browser.
4. The browser uses the **IP address** to connect to the correct server 🔗.


### 🎯 Benefits of AWS Route 53
- ⚡ **Fast & Reliable:** High-speed DNS resolution with AWS infrastructure.
- 📈 **Scalable:** Handles millions of DNS queries efficiently.
- 🔒 **Secure:** Supports DNSSEC for domain security.
- 🤝 **Integrates with AWS Services:** Works seamlessly with **EC2, S3, CloudFront**, and other AWS resources.

# 🚀 Amazon CloudFront (CDN - Content Delivery Network)

## 🌍 What is CloudFront?
Amazon CloudFront is a **web service** that enables businesses and web application developers to **distribute content efficiently**, ensuring:
- **Low latency ⚡**
- **High availability 🔄**
- **Cost-effective delivery 💰**

---

## 🔗 How CloudFront Works
Imagine a **server is located in the U.S.** 🌎, but users from **India 🇮🇳** and **Dubai 🇦🇪** are accessing the website hosted there.  
Without a CDN, the request has to travel to the U.S., increasing **latency ⏳** (the time taken for request and response).  

### ✅ Solution: CloudFront Edge Locations  
CloudFront places **Edge Locations 📍** worldwide to **cache** content closer to users:
1. **User request goes to the nearest Edge Location.**  
2. **If it’s the first request**, the **Edge Location fetches** content from the origin **U.S. server** and delivers it to the user.  
3. **Next time, CloudFront serves content directly** from the Edge Location (instead of fetching from the U.S.), **reducing latency** ⚡.  
4. **Cached content stays in the Edge Location for 24 hours 🕒**, ensuring faster responses for repeated requests.

# 🚀 Amazon SQS & SNS Explained Simply  

## 🏷️ **Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service)**  
Think of SQS like a **waiting line at a movie theater** 🎥🍿. Messages (tasks) arrive in the queue and wait for their turn to be processed. The system ensures messages don’t get lost, even if things get busy.  

### 🔹 **Key Features**  
- 🛠️ **Purpose:** Helps different parts of an application communicate without being directly connected.  
- 📩 **How it works:** Messages are placed in a queue 📬, and workers process them when they are ready.  
- 🛍️ **Example Use Case:** An **e-commerce website** 🛒 uses SQS to handle customer orders. When an order is placed, it goes into the queue, and the system processes it one by one.

![SQS Diagram](https://github.com/akash08-ak/AWS-Project-Setup/blob/main/Images/SQS.png)

### 📌 SQS Message Processing Flow
- A **user uploads a video** 🎥 to **Server A1 or A2**.
- The video is then **stored in Amazon S3** 🗄️.
- A **message is sent to the Amazon SQS queue** 📩.
- **Servers B1 and B2** 🔎 constantly monitor the queue.
- Once a message arrives, **one of the servers (B1 or B2) picks it up** to process the video.


### ⏳ **Visibility Timeout**
When **Server B1 picks up a message** for processing:
- That message **becomes invisible** ⛔ to other servers (such as B2) **for a set period** (Visibility Timeout).
- This **prevents duplicate processing** ⚠️ by multiple servers at the same time.
- If **B1 successfully processes the message**, ✅ it is **removed** from the queue.

### ❌ **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)**
What happens if **Server B1 fails to process** the message?
1. ⏳ After the **visibility timeout** expires, the message becomes **visible again**, allowing **Server B2** to pick it up.
2. 🛑 If **both Server B1 and B2** fail multiple times ⏳, the message is **moved to the Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)**.
3. 🔎 DLQ stores **failed messages** for further investigation and troubleshooting 🛠️.

### 🔄 **Process Overview**
1️⃣ **User uploads a video** → 📤 Server A1/A2 → 🗄️ Stored in S3  
2️⃣ **Message added to SQS** 📩 → Servers B1 & B2 **watch** it  
3️⃣ **Processing starts** 🚀 → One server picks it up  
4️⃣ ✅ If processed successfully → **Message removed**  
5️⃣ ❌ If failed → **Visibility timeout ends** → Other server tries  
6️⃣ ❗ If failed multiple times → **Moved to DLQ for further debugging**


---

## 📢 **Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service)**  
SNS is more like a **radio broadcast** 📡—it sends messages instantly to multiple people at once. If something important happens, SNS will alert multiple services or users.  

### 🔹 **Key Features**  
- 🚀 **Purpose:** Delivers messages instantly to multiple subscribers.  
- 🔔 **How it works:** One sender **publishes** a message, and all **subscribers** receive it.  
- ⛈️ **Example Use Case:** A **weather app** 🌦️ uses SNS to send alerts to users about severe storms.

---

## 🔍 Key Differences: SQS vs. SNS  

| 📌 Feature           | 🎟️ SQS (Queue)                      | 📡 SNS (Broadcast)           |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Message Type**     | Stored and processed later ⏳       | Instant notification ⚡      |
| **Who Receives It?** | One system picks up each message 🎯 | Many receivers at once 📢    |
| **Best For**         | Handling tasks in order ✅          | Sending alerts or updates 🔥 |
